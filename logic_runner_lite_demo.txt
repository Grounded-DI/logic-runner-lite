**[Logic Runner Lite – Demo Output + Prompt Guide]**

🎓 Sample Prompt:
Run logic check: If someone exercises daily and eats healthy, will they live longer?

---

🧠 Logic Setup:

Let:
• A = The person exercises daily
• B = The person eats healthy
• C = The person will live longer

Claim: (A ∧ B) → C

---

🔍 Logic Evaluation:

• This is a standard implication (→).
• It is false only when (A ∧ B) is true and C is false.
• Otherwise, the implication holds logically.

🧠 Interpretation:
The claim is valid in structure — but does not prove causation. Logic checks structure, not real-world outcomes. To confirm C, empirical data is required.

✅ Conclusion:
If both A and B are true, then C follows logically under this implication. The form is valid.
