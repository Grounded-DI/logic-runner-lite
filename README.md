# DI LogicRunner Lite – Free Demo Edition


**Deterministic Intelligence by Grounded DI**  
**Expires 10 days from activation**

---

## 🚀 Purpose

**DI LogicRunner Lite** is a free, safe demonstration of deterministic logic embedded within a language model environment. It allows anyone to interact with logical structures that follow rules — not probability.

Unlike probabilistic models that guess next-word patterns, **DI LogicRunner Lite** responds using a logic-tree backbone, creating structured, reliable answers.

## 🧠 Why It’s Free

We believe the public should experience deterministic intelligence first-hand. This version is limited, expires after 10 days, and is designed for educational, safe, and exploratory purposes.  
It's part of a broader initiative to showcase trustworthy AI that doesn’t hallucinate or make things up.

## ✅ How to Activate

Say or type:

```
Activate Logic Runner Lite
```

Once activated, you can try logic-based prompts like:

- “Run logic check: Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?”
- “Run rule test: If X implies Y, and Y is false, what about X?”
- “Show logic chain for: planning a weekend trip using weather and budget constraints.”
